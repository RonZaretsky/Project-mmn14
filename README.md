# Maman 14 - Final Project

Dear Tester, 

Thank you for taking the time to review my work.

I would like to explain how to use my Project.

I worked on the makefile a lot of time so it would work perfect and easy.

so at first, to compile the project you need to run the following in the terminal:

```bash
  make
```

than, before running the program you need to add the test files.

so you go assets folder and inside of it go to as_files folder, there you put your test files.

the next step is to add the name of the files to the make makefile.

you open the make file and enter the name of the file without the extension in the "args" veriable, you can see there is also an exmaple with test1 test2

than you run the following in the terminal 
```bash
  make run
```
